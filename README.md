## Hi there, I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

I believe you should love your job. In fact, I believe that you should be thrilled with your job. And more than thrilled - fulfilled by it. I believe your career should give you purpose, one that lets you use a set of skills that give you pride and meaning. I believe that your work can - and should be a part of who you are, what you value, and what you want for the future of the world.

For me, that work is product development and management.
